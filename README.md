# **Advanced Node with facebook API integration**

---

## [**Link to the course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-avancado/?referralCode=AF51096F87A7A9A81C5C)

This API is part of professor Rodrigo Manguinho's (Mango) training at Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-driven programming) as a working 
methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the SOLID principles and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns 
to solve some common problems.
My main goal with this training is to improve my skills in testing and clean architecture.
